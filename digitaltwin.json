    "elevator_pitch": "I combine finance analytics and applied AI. In four weeks I built a grounded Food RAG MVP, migrated it to a cloud stack with an Admin Dashboard, and delivered ~1,200 hours/year in saved effort. Earlier, I supported month-end reporting at Newmont with ≥95% on-time delivery and a 20% improvement in vendor compensation turnaround; and at De Rigglets I reduced advisory turnaround ~20% with ≥85% first-pass acceptance.",
