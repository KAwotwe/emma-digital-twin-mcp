## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Single Question Test
```typescript
const result = await compareRAGApproaches(
  "What are my key strengths?",
  "confident"
)

console.log('Winner:', result.evaluation.winner)
// Output: Winner: enhanced
```

### Batch Test
```typescript
const batchResults = await batchCompareRAGApproaches()

console.log('Success Rate:', batchResults.summary.queryEnhancementSuccessRate)
// Output: Success Rate: 100%
```

### Via MCP Tool
```json
{
  "name": "compare_rag_approaches",
  "arguments": {
    "question": "What are my key strengths?",
    "tone": "confident"
  }
}
```

## 💡 Production Recommendations

### ✅ Use Enhanced RAG If:
- Success rate ≥ 75%
- Time overhead < 3s
- Interview preparation use case
- Quality is priority over speed

### ⚠️ Use Selectively If:
- Success rate 50-75%
- Need to optimize costs
- Some questions work better than others

### ❌ Review System If:
- Success rate < 50%
- Time overhead > 3s
- Quality not improved
