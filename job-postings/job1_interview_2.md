# PHASE 1: INITIAL SCREENING (5 minutes)

*[Critical screening mode: HIGHLY CRITICAL]*

**Interviewer:** Good morning Emmanuel. I'm conducting a follow-up assessment for the Data Analyst position at iSelect after reviewing your updated profile.

## Updated Screening Questions

**Question 1:** Your profile now shows "Currently on student visa, applying for working visa after Masters completion in November 2025." This is clearer than before. Can you confirm the exact timeline for your work authorization and whether you'd need sponsorship in the interim?

**Question 2:** You've updated your experience section showing the AUSBIZ internship as "May 2025 – September 2025." This appears to be future-dated. Can you clarify your actual current experience level versus projected experience?

**Question 3:** I see you've added portfolio evidence with Tableau dashboards including "Australian International Trade (1988–2024)" and "Australian Open Finals Analysis." Can you walk me through the complexity of these dashboards and the business insights they provided?

**Question 4:** Your technical skills now show specific proficiency levels: Python (4/5), SQL (4/5), JavaScript (3/5). The role requires advanced SQL and Python. Can you give me production examples that justify these 4/5 ratings?

# PHASE 2: TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT (10 minutes)

## Enhanced Technical Deep Dive

**Question 5:** Your portfolio shows work with datasets spanning 1988-2024 trade data. What was the actual size of these datasets, what performance optimizations did you implement, and how did you handle data quality issues across decades of data?

**Question 6:** You mention "Australian International Trade Analysis" with KPIs like "36-year trade evolution" and "Economic trend identification." How did you define these KPIs, what stakeholders did you engage with, and what business decisions did these insights enable?

**Question 7:** For your RAG system, you now detail "Upstash Vector, Groq API, V0.dev." How would you scale this to handle iSelect's millions of customer records, implement proper data governance, and ensure sub-second query performance?

**Question 8:** Your Tableau portfolio shows "Long-term economic trends" and "Performance pattern analysis." Can you demonstrate how you built complex calculated fields, created advanced visualizations, and measured user adoption of your dashboards?

**Question 9:** You quantify "≥95% on-time delivery" at Newmont. Walk me through how you created this KPI framework, what metrics you tracked, how you measured variance, and how you drove continuous improvement.

# PHASE 3: CULTURAL FIT ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

## Updated Behavioral Assessment

**Question 10:** Your updated profile shows progression from accounting to AI/data analytics. iSelect needs someone who can adapt quickly to our fast-paced comparison services environment. How do you ensure rapid delivery without sacrificing quality?

**Question 11:** You mention "Cross-functional collaboration" with developers and analysts for the RAG launch. Give me a specific example where you had to align multiple stakeholders with conflicting priorities and deliver results.

**Question 12:** iSelect serves millions of Australians comparing financial products. Your background is more B2B focused. How would you approach analyzing consumer behavior patterns and developing customer segmentation strategies?
