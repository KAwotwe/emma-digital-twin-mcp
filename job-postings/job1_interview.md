# PHASE 1: INITIAL SCREENING (5 minutes)

*[Critical screening mode: HIGHLY CRITICAL]*

**Interviewer:** Good morning Emmanuel. I'm reviewing your profile for the Data Analyst position at iSelect. Let me get straight to the critical factors.

## Screening Questions

**Question 1:** This role is based in Melbourne VIC with hybrid arrangements. You're currently in Australia - can you confirm your exact location and willingness to work from Melbourne? What's your current visa status since you mentioned student visa in your profile?

**Question 2:** The role requires 2-5+ years in data analytics. You graduated in 2021 but show mostly accounting roles until recently. How do you justify having sufficient data analytics experience for this mid-level position?

**Question 3:** Looking at the technical requirements - they need strong SQL and Python proficiency, plus experience with Tableau/Power BI. You list SQL as "Advanced, 4 years" but Python as "Advanced, 2 years." Can you give me specific examples of production SQL and Python work you've done at enterprise scale?

**Question 4:** The role specifically mentions AI technologies like RAG systems as desirable. Your RAG project appears to be a 4-week bootcamp project. How does this single project qualify you for an enterprise AI role?

# PHASE 2: TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT (10 minutes)

## Technical Deep Dive

**Question 5:** Walk me through your most complex SQL query. The role involves analyzing large datasets - what's the largest dataset you've worked with and what were the performance considerations?

**Question 6:** Your Food RAG system - explain the technical architecture. How did you handle vector embeddings, what was your chunking strategy, and how did you ensure data quality in production?

**Question 7:** They use cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. You mention Upstash and Vercel. How would you migrate your current RAG system to AWS infrastructure with proper CI/CD pipelines?

**Question 8:** The role requires building dashboards in Power BI or Tableau. Show me specific examples of dashboards you've built with complex KPI calculations and real business impact.

**Question 9:** They need someone to define and track KPIs. At Newmont, you achieved "â‰¥95% on-time delivery" - what specific KPIs did you create and how did you measure them?

# PHASE 3: CULTURAL FIT ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

## Behavioral Assessment

**Question 10:** iSelect is a fast-paced comparison service company. Your background shows slower-paced mining and advisory firms. How do you adapt to rapid decision-making environments?

**Question 11:** The role requires collaboration with cross-functional teams. Your experience shows mostly individual contributor roles. Give me an example of leading a technical project with multiple stakeholders.

**Question 12:** This position involves translating business needs into data insights. Your background is more technical implementation. How would you approach a business stakeholder who wants "better customer insights" but can't articulate specific requirements?

# PHASE 4: FINAL ASSESSMENT REPORT

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT HIRE**
**Overall Suitability Score: 4/10**

### Key Reasons for Rejection:
- **Experience Gap:** Only 6 months of genuine data analytics experience vs. 2-5 years required
- **Technical Depth Insufficient:** RAG system is bootcamp-level, not enterprise-grade
- **Location/Visa Risk:** Student visa creates immediate employment barriers
- **Cultural Mismatch:** Background in slow-paced industries vs. fast-paced comparison services

## DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### Technical Competency Matrix (1-5 scale, 3+ required)

| Skill | Required Level | Candidate Level | Score | Gap Analysis |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-------|--------------|
| SQL | Advanced | Advanced | **4/5** | Strong foundation, needs scale experience |
| Python | Advanced | Intermediate+ | **3/5** | Limited production experience |
| Power BI/Tableau | Proficient | Basic | **2/5** | Mentions tools but no portfolio evidence |
| Cloud Platforms | Working Knowledge | Limited | **2/5** | Only Vercel/Upstash, no AWS/GCP/Azure |
| Data Visualization | Advanced | Basic | **2/5** | No complex dashboard portfolio |
| Statistical Analysis | Advanced | Academic | **3/5** | University projects, limited real-world |
| AI/ML Technologies | Desirable | Entry-level | **2/5** | Single 4-week project |

**Technical Average: 2.6/5 (Below minimum threshold)**

### Experience Relevance Analysis
- **Relevant Experience:** 6 months (AUSBIZ internship only)
- **Role Requirement:** 2-5 years
- **Experience Gap:** 75% shortfall
- **Industry Alignment:** Poor (mining/advisory vs. comparison services)

### Cultural Fit Evaluation
- **Leadership Experience:** Limited to academic projects
- **Team Collaboration:** Mostly individual contributor roles  
- **Business Acumen:** Strong financial background but limited customer-facing analytics
- **Communication:** Good presentation skills but lacks stakeholder management

### Critical Risk Factors
1. **Visa Status:** Student visa requires sponsorship - immediate barrier
2. **Experience Overselling:** Claims "Advanced" skills with limited evidence
3. **Scale Mismatch:** Small projects vs. enterprise requirements
4. **Industry Transition:** No experience in fast-paced consumer services

## IMPROVEMENT AREAS

### Immediate Skill Gaps to Address:
1. **Build substantial Power BI/Tableau portfolio** with complex business dashboards
2. **Gain enterprise cloud experience** on AWS/GCP/Azure platforms  
3. **Complete larger-scale data projects** working with millions of records
4. **Develop stakeholder management experience** in business environments

### Missing Profile Information:
- Specific dataset sizes worked with
- Actual dashboard examples and business impact
- Enterprise-level technical architecture experience
- Customer analytics or comparison industry knowledge

### Better Interview Positioning:
- **Stop overselling experience** - be honest about graduate level
- **Focus on learning velocity** rather than claiming advanced skills
- **Emphasize measurable business impact** from existing projects
- **Address visa status proactively** with sponsorship discussion

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Target graduate/junior analyst roles** (1-2 years experience)
2. **Complete substantial portfolio project** with enterprise tools
3. **Gain cloud certifications** (AWS/Azure fundamentals)
4. **Secure visa status** before applying to senior roles

## INTERVIEW OUTCOME

**FINAL VERDICT:** Promising graduate candidate applying for wrong level. Recommend 12-18 months additional experience before reapplying for mid-level positions.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Candidate has potential but is underqualified for this specific role
- Would be better suited for graduate or junior analyst positions
- Technical foundation exists but lacks enterprise-scale experience
- Visa status creates immediate hiring complications

**Recommendation for Candidate:**
Focus on building portfolio with enterprise tools, gaining relevant work experience, and targeting appropriate experience levels for future applications.
