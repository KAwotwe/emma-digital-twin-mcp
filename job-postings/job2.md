## Job Description

### The Opportunity
**"Your first job doesn't have to mean coffee runs and spreadsheets. Here, you'll be building things that actually matter."**

**Development Process:**

- Tighten it
- Polish it until people say: "Wait... this was manual before?"

We're after someone who loves the craft ‚Äî the kind of person who sees a target and won't stop until the workflow they've built doesn't just deliver results... it soars.
