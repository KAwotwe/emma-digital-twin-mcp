# PHASE 1: INITIAL SCREENING (5 minutes)

*[Critical screening mode: HIGHLY CRITICAL]*

**Interviewer:** Good morning Emmanuel. I'm reviewing your profile for the Graduate AI Workflow Engineer position at First Focus IT. This is a graduate role, but we still have critical requirements to assess.

## Screening Questions

**Question 1:** This role is based in Melbourne VIC with hybrid arrangements and requires Australian working rights. You mentioned student visa status - can you confirm your current visa allows full-time employment, or would you need sponsorship? This is crucial for a graduate role.

**Question 2:** The salary is up to $85k for a graduate position. What are your salary expectations, and are you comfortable starting at a graduate level despite having some previous work experience?

**Question 3:** We need someone with Python plus AI/automation libraries. You list Python as "Advanced, 2 years" - can you give me specific examples of AI/automation projects you've built using Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or workflow automation tools?

**Question 4:** This role is about building real solutions from day one. Your Food RAG system - walk me through how long it took to build and deploy, and what was the actual business impact or user adoption?

# PHASE 2: TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT (10 minutes)

## Technical Deep Dive

**Question 5:** We use workflow tools like Power Automate, Zapier, n8n. Have you used any of these? If not, how would you approach learning a new workflow automation platform quickly?

**Question 6:** Describe your RAG system architecture again, but this time focus on the automation aspects. How did you handle data ingestion, processing pipelines, and deployment automation?

**Question 7:** The role involves connecting APIs and platforms. In your RAG project, what APIs did you integrate? Walk me through the most complex API integration you've implemented.

**Question 8:** We work with cloud basics on AWS, Azure, or GCP. You mention Upstash and Vercel. How would you approach migrating to AWS and setting up automated deployment pipelines?

**Question 9:** This role requires translating "messy business needs into clean automations." Give me an example of a time you took an unclear requirement and built a working solution. What was your process?

**Question 10:** We pride ourselves on iterating from MVP to polished solutions. How do you approach the MVP → refinement → polish cycle? What's your definition of "done"?

---

# PHASE 3: CULTURAL FIT ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

## Behavioral Assessment

**Question 11:** First Focus has a "builder's culture" - people who love to create things that work. You say you've "built that" - what's the project you're most proud of building from scratch?

**Question 12:** We're looking for someone who won't stop until workflows "soar" rather than just work. How do you define excellence in automation? When do you stop iterating?

**Question 13:** This is a graduate role with rapid growth potential. Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years, and how does this role fit your career trajectory?

**Question 14:** We support 35,000+ end-users across diverse clients. How comfortable are you with the responsibility of building systems that thousands of people depend on?
