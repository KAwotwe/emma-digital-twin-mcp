### QUESTION 1: Cultural Fit & Company Values
**"iSelect is part of the comparison services industry, helping millions of Australians make informed decisions about insurance, energy, and loans. We're a fast-paced, collaborative environment where data drives our business decisions. What attracts you to working in the comparison services space, and how do you handle fast-paced work environments?"**

### QUESTION 2: Qualification Verification
**"The role requires 2-5+ years of data analytics experience with strong SQL and Python skills, plus experience with Tableau or Power BI. Your profile shows a recent transition from accounting to data analytics. Can you walk me through your relevant data analytics experience and confirm you have working knowledge of our required tech stack?"**

### QUESTION 3: Compensation Alignment

### QUESTION 4: Availability & Visa Status
**"This position is hybrid in Melbourne with start date flexibility. I notice from your profile you're on a student visa. Can you confirm your work authorization status and when you'd be available to start if selected?"**

### QUESTION 5: Motivation & Career Goals
**"You've made a significant career transition from accounting to data analytics and AI. What's driving this change, and how does this role at iSelect fit into your longer-term career goals?"**

## RECRUITER'S ASSESSMENT

**Based on the digital twin profile and job posting requirements, this candidate would likely receive:**

### **CONDITIONAL PASS - PROCEED WITH CAUTION**

**Reasoning:**
- **Technical Foundation:** Has relevant RAG system and Python/SQL experience
