## 🧮 Comparison Metrics Explained

### Time Metrics

**Processing Time**: Time to complete the query
- **Basic RAG**: ~300-400ms (vector search only)
- **Enhanced RAG**: ~2000-2200ms (query enhancement + search + formatting)
- **Acceptable Range**: < 3000ms

**Time Overhead**: Additional time for enhancements
- **Formula**: `Enhanced Time - Basic Time`
- **Percentage**: `(Overhead / Basic Time) * 100`
- **Expected Range**: +1500-2000ms (+400-600%)

**Total Comparison Time**: Time to run both approaches in parallel
- **Note**: Slightly faster than sequential due to Promise.all()

---

### Quality Metrics

**Length Improvement**: Additional characters in enhanced response
- **Formula**: `Enhanced Length - Basic Length`
- **Percentage**: `(Improvement / Basic Length) * 100`
- **Expected Range**: +150-250%

**Query Enhanced**: Whether query preprocessing improved the search query
- **Indicator**: `enhancedQuery !== originalQuery`
- **Expected**: true (100% of cases)

**Enhancement Applied**: Breakdown of which stages were enabled
- **Query Preprocessing**: Step 4 enhancement
- **Response Formatting**: Step 5 formatting
- **Both**: Full pipeline

---

### Winner Determination

**Automatic Winner Selection**:
```typescript
winner: enhancedLength > basicLength && enhancedResult.success 
  ? 'enhanced' 
  : 'basic'
```

**Factors**:
1. ✅ Enhanced response is longer
2. ✅ Enhanced pipeline succeeded
3. ✅ Time overhead is acceptable (< 3s)
